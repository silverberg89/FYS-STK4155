\section{Code Implementation}
The python programming language is used for implementation of the methods. An the Python packages Numpy, Scikit learn and Tensorflow are used extensively because of their rich machine learning functionality. In terms of computational time, the Tensorflow package is a few order of magnitude faster compared to our own codes developed by the theory described above, we will therefore only focus on using this package when running the relevant calculations.

Overall code structure:

\begin{verbatim}
     Runnable classes:
       * SVM and Logistic regression.py
         Used for calculating SVM and regression results.
       * Binary neural network.py
         Used for calculating NN results.
     Runnable files:
       * variable_analysis.py
         Used for analysing the variables.
     Imported Files:
       * methods.py
         Holds various functions needed for the project.
       * data.py
         Loads the dataset properly.
       * Flipped counties.py
         Only used for drawing a map of flipped counties.
       * k_fold_CV.py
         Used for cross validation.
       * to_binary.py
         Used for changing the target and output into binary.
