The main purpose of the project was to successfully reproduce the election outcome of 2012 and 2016 in the US, as well as identify important variables. Data for analysing ranged from economics, demographics to ethnicity, among other variables. The data was first constructed into a design matrix and further standardized.

Various machine learning algorithms was deployed for completing the task, where accuracy score was the main metric. The Support Vector Machine with kernel [SVM] produced the best classification results of 89\% for the 2012 election and 96\% for the 2016. The method of Neural Network surprisingly performed almost as good with 87\% for 2012 and 94\% for 2016, while the logistic regression came out slightly worse.

The variables that contributed the most for correct classification were the age and population size of the counties. Regarding flipped counties between the elections, the SVM method hinted that the percentage of females and whites may have had a minor impact on the shift from one party to another.
